The Contacts Dataframe was created using Pandas. Due to the nature of the data in the contacts csv file, the json.loads function was used to effectively parse the data and display all the rows. Next a Pandas Dataframe was created with the relevant columns, to list the data accordingly. 

The values in the name column were separated into first and last names using the split function, and the original name column was dropped. The data was then further cleaned and modified by rearranging the columns in a more suitable manner. Once the cleaning was complete, the cleaned data was finally exported as a csv file.
